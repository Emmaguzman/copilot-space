# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Overview
This folder collects OctoAcme's project management processes, standards, and templates to help teams plan, deliver, and continuously improve work. The guidance emphasizes clear initiation and stakeholder alignment, iterative planning and delivery, proactive risk management, and continuous improvement via retrospectives.

Key points:
- Start with a short Project One-pager to align stakeholders and define measurable success metrics.
- Plan work into small, testable increments with clear acceptance criteria and a Definition of Done.
- Track execution with a project board, CI-backed PR workflows, and regular team rhythms (standups, weekly syncs, demos).
- Capture risks in a lightweight Risk Register and communicate status to stakeholders regularly.
- Standardize release and rollback practices, and run retrospectives to turn learnings into action items.
